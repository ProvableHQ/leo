## 1. Overview

Welcome to the Leo programming language.

Leo provides a high-level language that abstracts low-level cryptographic concepts and makes it easy to 
integrate private applications into your stack. Leo compiles to circuits making zero-knowledge proofs practical.

The syntax of Leo is influenced by traditional programming languages like JavaScript, Scala, and Rust, with a strong emphasis on readability and ease-of-use.
Leo offers developers with tools to sanity check circuits including unit tests, integration tests, and console functions.

Leo is one part of a greater ecosystem for building private applications on [Aleo](https://aleo.org/). 
The language is currently in an alpha stage and is subject to breaking changes.

## 2. Build Guide

### 2.1 Install Rust

We recommend installing Rust using [rustup](https://www.rustup.rs/). You can install `rustup` as follows:

- macOS or Linux:
  ```bash
  curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
  ```

- Windows (64-bit):  
  
  Download the [Windows 64-bit executable](https://win.rustup.rs/x86_64) and follow the on-screen instructions.

- Windows (32-bit):  
  
  Download the [Windows 32-bit executable](https://win.rustup.rs/i686) and follow the on-screen instructions.

### 2.2 Build from Source Code

We recommend installing Leo by building from the source code as follows:

```bash
# Download the source code
git clone https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo
cd leo

# Install 'leo'
$ cargo install --path .
```

Now to use leo, in your terminal, run:
```bash
leo
```

## 3. Quick Start

Use the Leo CLI to create a new project

```bash
# create a new `hello-world` Leo project
leo new helloworld
cd helloworld

# build & setup & prove & verify
leo run
```

The `leo new` command creates a new Leo project with a given name.

The `leo run` command will compile the program into Aleo instructions and run it.

Congratulations! You've just run your first Leo program.

## 4. Troubleshooting
If you are are having trouble installing and using Leo, please check out our [guide](docs/troubleshooting.md).

If the issue still persists, please [open an issue](https://github.com/AleoHQ/leo/issues/new/choose).
